# Bitmap fonts
Monospaced bitmap programming fonts

Features:
- Unicode support with lots of icons.
- 2 sizes, smaller one has 2 pixel descent instead of 3, thus is more vertically condensed.
- Supports ranger devicons, nerdtree icons, powerline etc.

.otb format for compatibility with pango 1.44+ // .txt file with icons if you want to copy-paste

Notes:
- Some icon glyphs might be out of place or have new, non-existing ones.
- Not all glyphs are present in the previews. Mostly accented characters and...
  half of braille. Yeah I almost went blind making that, so I gave up :)
- In some places (like gvim) the fonts are detected as 9 and 10 pixels, I don't know why. All works fine though.
- Made for personal use, but here you go... Give me some tips, I don't know what I am doing :)
