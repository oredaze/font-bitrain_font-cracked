Monospaced bitmap programming fonts with unicode support and lots of icons.

2 sizes, smaller one has 2 pixel descent instead of 3, thus is more vertically condensed. 

.otb format for compatibility with pango 1.44+
.txt file with icons if you want to copy-paste

Notes:
- Some icon glyphs might be out of place or have new, non-existing ones.
- Not all glyphs are present in the previews. Mostly accented characters and...
